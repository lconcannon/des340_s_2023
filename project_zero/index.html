   <h1 style="color:blue;">Kill Bill by SZA</h1>

   <p>I'm still a fan even though i was salty, hate to see you with some other broad know youre happy, hate to see you happy if im not the one driving. im so mature, im so mature, im so mature i got me a therapist to tell me theres other men, i dont want them i just want you. if i cant have you no one should.</p>

   <p>I might...I might kill my ex, not the best idea. his new girl is next. howd i get here? i might kill my ex, i still love him though. would rather be in jail than alone. I get the sense that it's a lost cause. I get the sense that you might really love her. the text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence i tried to ration with, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn. you was out of reach, you was at the farmers market with your perfect peach. Now im in amazement, playing on my patience. Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat.</p>
